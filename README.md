# Iris Species Classifier

 This is a simple web app that determines the sub-species of the flower Iris using 4 different parameters which denots the dimensions of its petals.
 The dataset used is the very popular Iris dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris ) and we implement a simple machine learning algorithm to predict the result.
 
 ### This web app was built using `streamlit` and deployed on `Heroku`
